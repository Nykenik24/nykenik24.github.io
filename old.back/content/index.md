Welcome to my website, where I will yap about code and share my projects, favourite music, additional things that I make (songs?), etc.

I am not a native English speaker, so expect grammatical errors or constant typos, it's normal. I am probably adding [i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) later.
