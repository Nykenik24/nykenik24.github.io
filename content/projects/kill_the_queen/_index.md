Kill the queen is a small, free and open-source roguelike about using only three skills to level up, kill bosses and finally **kill the queen**. This is where I will posts updates about the game, such as: devlogs, anouncements, etc. You can read more about the idea [here](/posts/another_idea)

The game is being made in [LÖVE](https://love2d.org), an open-source Lua game framework.
