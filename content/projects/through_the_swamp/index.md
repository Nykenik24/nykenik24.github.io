title: 'Through The Swamp'
---

## Status
Through The Swamp is currently **W.I.P**, to support the project and its development, [star the repository](https://github.com/Nykenik24/through-the-swamp).

## Overview
Through The Swamp is an 8-bit **small**, linear, **relaxing** game where you control a frog crossing a huge swamp to get to his friend. You need to complete tiny and fun levels with puzzles that range from simple to, well, *not that simple*.

The game is **fully open-source** and completely **non-profit**. It's just a fun project made by a bored man.

## Story
The story of the game is simple: you, a frog, feel asleep in a lily pad and ended up in the other side of the swamp. Your objective now: getting to your folk, at the **other side of the huge swamp**.
