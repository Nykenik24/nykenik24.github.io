### *This is a test post, made to test the blog, ignore it lmao*

Oh, how iconic is *Hello, World!*, right? It ranges from:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
To:
```cs
using System;

public class Program {
    public static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
And is used by basically every language as a "getting started" code snippet.

But how did affect programming? `I d o n o t k n o w`.

Thanks for reading.
