### Welcome
This is my blog, where I will rant about things that only people willing to read this will care about in a broken English because it's not even my main language. __Yes, if you already red that then you are cursed, sorry!__

If you want to know more about me and not about the blog, go [here](/about).

### This one WILL be active.
Jokes aside, I've been wanting to make a blog months ago, but every time I tried I ended up forgetting, as I just posted perfectly crafted posts instead of posting like a real blogger (=everything that goes through my head and is mildly interesting I guess).

To make this true I will put one simple rule for myself: _one post per week_. That's the minimum.

It might seem that I am just forcing myself to post and that I will end up stressing so much I will post whatever just to comply, but __don't worry__, so many things I want to share go through my head, so I will have something to post weekly 100% guaranteed.

### What you will probably find here
If, for some weird reason, you decided that reading this blog might be fun, then this is a list of what I expect to post:
- Yapping about projects I recently made/am making.
- A problem I encountered and the solution I found (or, alternatively, a cry for help [to the void] if I didn't find a solution).
- Some cool idea that I randomly had and want to share.
- Recommendations of FOSS/Free tools that I recently started using.
- Miscellaneous stuff about things like additions my Arch Linux + Hyprland (yes, __I use arch btw__) setup, cool scripts or little tools I made/found that helped me a lot, etc. Basically Linux-related stuff.
- Some cool video/article I found that I think you (yes, __YOU__) should watch.
- Maybe a tutorial? Like, if I found a thing that was asked a lot or that I found difficult I will make a little post explaining it so maybe SEO lets you read it, luckily lmao.

I will almost never talk about my life, it will mostly be about programming and all of that.

### Goodbye
It's sad, but I have to say goodbye. It's a Friday (24/10), so I will start with the weekly posting Monday 27. Although expect a post tomorrow (25/10), I recently had a project idea, but I am too tired to also write that post today d:, __bai bai!!!!__.
