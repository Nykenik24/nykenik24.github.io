> Sorry for not posting last week, even if nobody reads this lmao.

Last sunday I was peacefully starting the development of my latest "project": Kill the queen. Remember [this post](/posts/another_idea), where I talk about this game I was going to make? Well, you probably know where this went.

If you don't, 5 words: **I abandoned yet another project**.
```
iusearchbtw :: ~/Projects » ls -lah archives
total 669M
beryll.zip cardinal.zip cocoa.zip conversible.zip glint.zip 
noble.zip pico86.zip  pine.zip psychics.zip textual.zip 
through_the_swamp.zip titanium.zip trout.zip vanadium.zip Zap.zip
```
*Yes, my device name is `iusearchbtw`, sorry for that.*

I imagine someone will still ask "What's that?" even if this blog is literally a programming blog, but well, I'll be inclusive. Basically, that's the folder where I store all my abandoned projects.

Instead of just `rm -rf`ing them, I zip them and store them there. So, 669MB of abandoned projects across **18 project archives**. By the way, these are not all projects I abandoned, just the ones I archived.

This is a worrying thing, like really. In 2 years I abandoned more than 18 projects, while a casual developer in that time frame would probably finish that quantity projects.

## The reason.
This HAS to stop. And I know how to stop it, fortunately.

I always abandon (let's hope I can finally say abandoned) projects because either:
- The project was too ambitious.
- Bad planning.
- No motivation.
- Bad idea.

The most common ones are no motivation and bad planning, although I have to say I have a rush of motivation at the start and then it starts horribly (bad planning) and I lose it all.

And, being honest, I hate abandoning projects *a lot*. 

It might seem counterintuitive: like, if I hate it so much, then why do I still abandon so many projects? And, I will answer with a simple:
**Because its impossible not to.**

When I abandon a project, I do it because my motivation drops to dead 0.

## The solution
Well, obviously, revolution: the only solution.

SOAD aside, there is a very simple solution: plan it properly, instead of just thinking about a vage and stupid idea and trying to instantly execute it perfectly, actually follow a process, do my research and, most importantly, make an actually good idea.

## The idea.
Remember that list of archives? Well, if you don't, then don't worry, its a bit pointless memorizing a list of zip files with names that you don't understand.

Well, from that list, 5 archives were programming languages (these are the ones I archived, there are more): 
> Fun fact: my dumb ass wrote "where" instead of "were" initially in the last phrase, read the phrase 4 times and still didn't notice I wrote "where" lol.
- Cocoa: It was so short I honestly don't remember it's original purpose lol.
- Glint: Small scripting language made in Lua.
- Noble: Java-like language without it's inmense complexity made in C.
- Titanium: I vagely remember it was a language similar to C or Zig made in Zig.
- Vanadium: The longest lasting one (still stopped not even half the way), a "revolutionary" language prioritizing "robustness" and "safety" (all bullshit tbh).

See a pattern? No? Well, obviously the pattern is that there is no pattern. 

I always tried to make something different from the other prior language projects.

> By the way, there will be some programming language terms like lexer or parser, if you don't know what they are, don't worry, you just need to know that:
> - A lexer is the most simple step which separates code into "tokens"
> - The parser basically converts plain text into a tree full of nodes.

If we look into development you *can* see some obvious patterns (although I am the only person that actually knows how development of these went, so don't think you were going to find them lmao):
- Scope creep (terrible one). Like, I tried to make whole specs/documentations of the languages before even having a lexer made.
- Over engineering for everything. A clear example is how I handled parsers: never got farther than that, always abandoned while I was making the parser (I hate parsers **RAHHHH**), as I always wanted to make helpers and types beforehand, instead of drafting a quick but working parser and later refactoring like a normal developer.
- Bad design.
- Bloat (dependencies).
- Choosing languages I don't know enough about to make a whole language.

So, if you learn about your errors, and I had lots of errors across 5 (probably 6, I remember a shell language that I didn't archive) iterations, so I guess I learned enough.

### The project.
> "Finally, the yapping stops! This guy should really shut up a bit, am I right?" \
> *You, probably*.

So, I am making a programming language. WAIT, don't throw tomatoes, I am NOT abandoning this on, I learned from the past.

Rules are:
- **NO ABANDONING!** Sorry, but in Nykenik, co. (ficticious company don't sue me pretty please) we adopted the euphemism "rethink" to replace the horrible word "ab\*ndon". This project doesn't just "e\*d" with a "motivation l\*ss", it will be **rethought**, **refactored** or **redesigned**.
- I will manage my time so I don't work all day on it, while also dedicating enough time. Yes, this is a rule, because these are rules for myself, and I am the owner of the blog B).
- One devlog per week minimum.
- Keep it in one repository without a website until I have v1.0 (or when I feel it's good enough to get it's own website and other expansions). Might seem a useless rule, but it's necessary for me.
- Keep a roadmap with only superficial milestones (for example "Complete lexical analysis" \[lexer and parser\], "Complete compiler/interpreter", etc.)

Some info (not sharing a lot because I changed and scope creep and over promising are terminally prohibited in this project.):
- I will upload it to my brother's *Forgejo* because I hate AI and don't want it to train on my code, so no GitHub.
- I will probably make it in C, and if that doesn't work then let's see what I do.
- As I didn't post last week, next two days (Friday 5/12 and Saturday 6/12) will be dedicated to research and design, and Sunday I will share what I did as a devlog in it's own [project section](/projects/).
- I don't have a name right now, I have to think about it. The name will be revealed in sunday's devlog.

**Let's hope this goes well.**
> By the way, if you are a reader (proably the only one), please show proof that you are alive, like, an email to my mail (nykenik24@proton.me) saying "hi you blog is cool :)"/"hi your blog is bad haha" (preferrably the first one, please) is enough.
