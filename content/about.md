Welcome! I am Nykenik24 or just Nykenik, a hobby programmer located in _Alguna parte_, Spain.

### What I do
I normally develop little utilities, little games, well little anything I want >;D. My favorite languages are probably Go, C and Lua.

You can find all my projects (or at least the ones that I wanted to share in the blog) [right here](/projects).

### Where to find me
You can:
- Contact me [by email](mailto:Nykenik24@proton.me).
- Go to [my GitHub](https://github.com/Nykenik24).

### Where to go now
I recommend you read [my first post](/posts/i_might_actually_post/), or see [all my posts](/posts).
