Hello, I am Nykenik24 *(or Nykenik)*, a hobby programmer apassionated with low-level systems, networking and how computers work overall.

I have made some projects, like a terminal-based secure chat app in Node, some [LOVE game framework](https://love2d.org) libraries and more, but I don't have any big projects, **for now >;)**.

I live in Spain, so I am not a native english speaker. If you find any typos or grammatical errors in one of my posts, let me know through a comment, or [contact me](mailto:Nykenik24@proton.me)!

### Workflow
- I use [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/) as my main OS.
- To code, I use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/).
- For productivity, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- To do basically everything, I use [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) as tty and [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/index.html) as shell.

### Socials
- I have an active [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Nykenik24), I commit there basically everythere.
- I also have an [itch.io profile](https://nykenik24.itch.io), but I didn't publish anything in a long time.
- I have a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@nykenik24), but it's dead. I may post devlogs in the future, if I get the confidence to do so.
